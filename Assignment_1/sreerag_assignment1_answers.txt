1. ROS nodes: Launch ROS core and carry out the following tasks
(a) List the currently running nodes
	(using : rosnode list)    
	
		/rosout

(b) What is the purpose of node /rosout

		The `rosout` node for subscribing, logging, and republishing the messages.

(c) List the currently running topics
	(using : rostopic list)
		
		/rosout
		/rosout_agg

(d) What topics are subscribed by the node /rosout
		
		/rosout 

(e) What topics are published by the node /rosout
		
		/rosout_agg

(f) What are the services provided by the node /rosout

		/rosout/get_loggers
 		/rosout/set_logger_level

(g) Kill the node /rosout and again list the running nodes. What is your observation.
	(Using : rosnode kill /rosout)

	Observation: While killing the node /rosout, it shows killed, but after killing and again listing the running node  shows the node /rosout


(h) What are the functions of commands cleanup, info, kill, list, machine &
ping of the rosnode command-line tool
	
	rosnode cleanup   purge registration information of unreachable nodes
	rosnode info      print information about node
	rosnode kill      kill a running node
	rosnode list      list active nodes
	rosnode machine   list nodes running on a particular machine or list machines
	rosnode ping      test connectivity to node
	

(i) Run the command rosnode info /rosout and Save its screenshot as question1_rqt1.png.
(j) Run the rqt_graph tool (Uncheck the debug option in the RosGraphwindow if the
rqt_graph is empty) and Save its screenshot as question1_rqt2.png.

2.
(b) while running rqt_graph we can see there are two running node, /sreerag_pubnode and /rosout
(d) In the rqt_graph we can see  the three publisher nodes with name "sreerag_node1" and the /rosout nodes are running simultaneously.

3.
(b) Here one publisher node with name '/sreerag_node1' with a topic 'Greetings'. that topic is subscribed by the Subscriber name '/RAA24_subnode' 

4.
(a) List the currently running nodes

	/CET
	/M1RAA_24_26_24494_1729677417498
	/rosout
	/sreerag_24147_1729677364939

(b) List the currently running topics
	/hello_class
	/hello_college
	/rosout
	/rosout_agg
	/welcome

(c) What is the role of the node rosout
	The `rosout` node for subscribing, logging, and republishing the messages.


(d) Change the name of node 2 to 'M1RAA 2024' and rerun the code. Write down any
error message displayed.

	'M1RAA 2024_34348_1729678584988' is not a legal ROS base name. This may cause problems with other ROS tools.
  rospy.init_node('M1RAA 2024',anonymous=True)
